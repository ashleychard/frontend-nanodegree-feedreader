# Project Overview

## What is the scenario of this project? 

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## What are the skills being demonstrated with this bit of code?

This project teaches about automated tests using Jasmine. I added the tests to the feedreader.js spec based on the comments set forth in the TODOs left by another developer.

## How do I run this application?

Download the code. Open the index.html file in your browser. The tests will automatically run as you launch index.html, or when you refresh the page.
